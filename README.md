# 📊 Break-Even Calculator

A modern, interactive React + TypeScript web app designed to help finance teams in SaaS businesses calculate break-even points, model profitability, and analyze cost structures with ease.

Break-even units are calculated per product using:

Break-even Units = Total Fixed Costs / Contribution Margin

Where:

- `Contribution Margin = Price - Variable Cost per Unit`
- Revenue to break-even and estimated monthly profits are also calculated.

Scenario planning uses different sales volumes to show:
- Revenue
- Total cost (including shared variable expenses)
- Profit/Loss
- Profit Margin
